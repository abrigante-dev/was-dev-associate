### A Developer is leveraging a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)-based AWS VPN connection to connect from on-premises to Amazon EC2 instances in the Developer's account. The Developer is able to access an EC2 instance in subnet A, but is unable to access an EC2 instance in subnet B in the same VPC. Which logs can the Developer use to verify whether the traffic is reaching subnet B?

- [ ] VPN logs.
- [ ] BGP logs
- [ ] VPC Flow Logs.
- [ ] AWS CloudTrail logs.


### A Developer has created a new AWS IAM user that has s3 putObject permission to write to a specific Amazon S3 bucket. This S3 bucket uses server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS) as the default encryption. Using the access key and secret key of the IAM user, the application received an access denied error when calling the PutObject API. How can this issue be resolved?

- [ ] Update the policy of the IAM user to allow the s3 Encrypt action.
- [ ] Update the bucket policy of the S3 bucket to allow the IAM user to upload objects.
- [ ] Update the policy of the IAM user to allow the kms:GenerateDataKey action.
- [ ] Update the ACL of the S3 bucket to allow the IAM user to upload objects.


### A company has a web application that uses an Amazon Cognito user pool for authentication. The company wants to create a login page with the company logo. What should a Developer do to meet these requirements?

- [ ] Create a hosted user interface in Amazon Cognito and customize it with the company logo.
- [ ] Create a login page with the company logo and upload it to Amazon Cognito.
- [ ] Create a login page in Amazon API Gateway with the logo and save the link in Amazon Cognito.
- [ ] Upload the logo to the Amazon Cognito app settings and point to the logo on a custom login page.


### A Developer is working on an AWS Lambda function that accesses Amazon DynamoDB. The Lambda function must retrieve an item and update some of its attributes, or create the item if it does not exist. The Lambda function has access to the primary key. Which IAM permissions should the Developer request for the Lambda function to achieve this functionality?

- [ ] dynamodb:DeleteItem dynamodb:GetItem dynamodb:PutItem.
- [ ] dynamodb:UpdateItem dynamodb:GetItem dynamodb:DescribeTable.
- [ ] dynamodb:GetRecords dynamodb:PutItem dynamodb:UpdateTable.
- [ ] dynamodb:UpdateItem dynamodb:GetItem dynamodb:PutItem.


### A Developer is storing sensitive data generated by an application in Amazon S3. The Developer wants to encrypt the data at rest. A company policy requires an audit trail of when the master key was used and by whom. Which encryption option will meet these requirements?

- [ ] Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
- [ ] Server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS).
- [ ] Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C).
- [ ] Server-side encryption with self-managed keys.


### A company's website runs on an Amazon EC2 instance and uses Auto Scaling to scale the environment during peak times. Website users across the world are experiencing high latency due to static content on the EC2 instance, even during non-peak hours. Which combination of steps will resolve the latency issue? (Choose TWO)

- [ ] Double the Auto Scaling group's maximum number of servers.
- [ ] Host the application code on AWS Lambda.
- [ ] Scale vertically by resizing the EC2 instances.
- [ ] Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to cache the static content.
- [ ] Store the application's static content in Amazon S3.
